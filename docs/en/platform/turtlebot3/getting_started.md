# [Getting Started](#getting-started)
This page is for users who are new to TurtleBot3. The manual has an enormous amount of content, but this page explains how information is divided.

## [About TurtleBot3](#about-turtlebot3)
First of all, collect information from the [Overview][overview], [Notices][notices], [Features][features], and [Specifications][specifications] pages to get an overall understanding of TurtleBot3.

## [First steps for using TurtleBot3](#first-steps-for-using-turtlebot3)
**WARNING**: Make sure to follow either of Setup guide (**ROS** or **ROS 2**). Otherwise, it may cause unexpected issue. 
{: .notice--warning}
When you have enough understanding about TurtleBot3 from above step, here are the software and hardware setups. Be aware that it is a time-saver to set up the SBC and your PC first, rather than assembling the robot. It is recommended to proceed in the following order.

1. **PC Setup**
- Install Linux, ROS and application software for TurtleBot3 on your **Remote PC**.
2. **SBC Setup**
- Install Linux, ROS and hardware related software to control the TurtleBot3 on your **TurtleBot PC**.
3. **OpenCR Setup**
- Upload latest firmware of TurtleBot3 to OpenCR embedded board.
4. **Hardware Setup**
- Assemble TurtleBot3 by follwing an **Assembly Manual**. Be sure to setup the SBC and OpenCR before assembling the robot.

**TIP** : If you want to use other products instead of SBCs and Sensors included in the TurtleBot3 package, please refer to the [Compatible Devices][compatible_devices] page.

## [Let's try the basic operation](#lets-try-the-basic-operation)
Once you have completed the above steps, run the robot through the provided **Bringup** package, and remotely move the robot with the teleoperation feature.  
Next, let's check various sensors' value mounted on the robot or learn how to control the robot by reading **Basic Operation** page.

## [Keep TurtleBot3's various technologies with you](#keep-turtlebot3s-various-technologies-with-you)
The TurtleBot3â€™s core technology is **SLAM**, **Navigation** and **Manipulation**, making it suitable for home service robots. These technologies can be applied either on a real robot or a virtual robot with **Simulation** feature.  
Of course, they can be implemented in TurtleBot3, such as **Autonomous Driving** and **Machine Learning**. In addition, we are introducing 12 different types of **Locomotion** as TurtleBot3 Friends, as well as differential drive mobile robot. With this openended component, handful of TurtleBot3 friends with various characteristics could be built. You can create a totally new robot that is never seen before. Also interesting applications such as Follower Demo, Panoramic Demo, and Automatic Parking are available. See **Applications** page for more application examples.

## [Learn and Explore more](#learn-and-explore-more)
The above are just a few examples of using TurtleBot3. You can learn more and challenge yourself with the following information.

You can **Learn** more through the ROS courses provided by the Construct, the various lectures created by TurtleBot3 users, web content, YouTube courses, free books, and more. In addition, various **Videos** produced by ROBOTIS will be helpful, and use cases using TurtleBot3 can be checked through various **Projects** released by TurtleBot3 research collaborators and TurtleBot3 users. You can also try a variety of challenges through **Challenges**.
