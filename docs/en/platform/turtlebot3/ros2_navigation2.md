# [Navigation2](#navigation2)

**Navigation** is to move a robot from one location to the specified destination in a given environment. For this purpose, a map that contains geometry information of furniture, objects, and walls of the given environment is required. As described in the previous [Cartographer](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/#cartographer) section, the map was created with the distance information obtained by the sensor and the pose information of the robot itself.

**Navigation** enables a robot to move from the current pose to the designated goal pose on the map by using the map, robotâ€™s encoder, IMU sensor, and distance sensor. The procedure for performing this task is as follows.

## [Run Navigation2 Nodes](#run-navigation2-nodes)

```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py map:=$HOME/map.yaml
```

- Click `2D Pose Estimate` button in a menu bar, and then point exact pose of TurtleBot3 on a map.
